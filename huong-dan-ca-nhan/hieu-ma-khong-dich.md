# How to you confirm your understanding of a sentence without relying on a translation?

also one thing that i learned when i had that same issue (wondering if im interpreting smth correctly) is that if you stay w that interpretation and read the rest of the story more often than not ur gonna be like “hm? but i thought it was this” and you can go back and see that u misinterpreted it and now youve got that new understanding that will stick out more

Remember when you were a kid and watched a kid movie and enjoyed it for what it was, then years later as you're older you go back to rewatch it and noticed you missed half the jokes and some plot subtlety that introduces adult themes that you didn't think would be there as a kid?  It's kinda the same thing sometimes. Understand that you will not get everything at first and enjoy what you can get, if stuff makes sense in context then it's good, if stuff stops making sense and you notice, it means you missed something important and can decide to go back to it again or ask someone for help. Over time your understanding will get better as you will gain more intuition and that's how you get better at Japanese
